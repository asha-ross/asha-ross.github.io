      <strong>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</strong> 
      <p>I've been thinking about
      this a lot, and what constitutes an "ethical decision". According to the
      internet, an ethical dilemma is where two values come into conflict. So
      for this section I've decided to talk about why I'm no longer vegan, but
      am more environmentally conscious. So, a few years ago I decided to try
      out veganism for a number of reasons. I found I quite liked it, although a
      complete change was really challenging in some places (while travelling in
      Japan, for instance). However, I found the discussions that would arise
      with other vegans to be very frustrating. There seemed to be a lack of
      critical thinking; almost all of the arguing was emotional. I understood
      that stance--one of the things I found to be such a relief about not
      eating meat was that I truly am an animal lover and found it hard to
      reconcile killing for food. HOWEVER. The more I thought critically about
      it, the more I realised it was an argument that just didn't hold up.
      Eating "vegan food" is not more environmentally conscious, and it doesn't
      ensure that no animals were killed for your food. Moreover, I was
      disturbed by the number of vegans who thought humans should have no
      contact with animal species at all. I don't believe segregation or the
      complete separation is the way to a more conscious and compassionate
      society. I truly believe it's not so much what we're doing, it's HOW we're
      doing it. Our mass production practices (overall, but specifically
      agriculture) are outrageous, and incredibly damaging to all parts of the
      cycle. The problems are much broader than simply whether or not you use or
      consume animal products. So instead I decided to embark upon a series of
      life changes, to head in a direction where I'd actually be taking
      responsible for my consumption, my waste, my food sources, and the
      compromises I'm willing (at this stage) to make. It has made me feel
      better to be approaching the problem in a more critical way. I feel like
      less of a hypocrite. So, instead of just abstaining from animal products,
      I now am a part of growing and raising my own food. I only eat eggs from
      the ducks and chickens we care for on a small plot of land. I know those
      animals have a great life. I grow as many of my own fruits and vegetables
      as I can, and try to trade for or harvest the rest (when I do buy them,
      I'm limiting myself to what is local and seasonal). I am still working on
      some other areas of consumption and limiting waste, but it's a journey. I
      have had to weigh up a whole series of smaller decisions, and it's this
      process that makes me feel like this is the right decision for me and my
      family at this time.</p> 
      
      <strong>Describe how your culture and the people around you
      have influenced your values and identity.</strong>

      />
      <p>My own values and identity stem
      from my love of literature. My family moved around a lot in my youth, and
      both my parents worked and studied throughout my childhood so I kind of
      feel most connected to my siblings and to the books I began to love early
      on. I was encouraged to read books and listen to music, to create my own
      games and generally take some responsibility for my own enjoyment and
      exploration of life. I credit my parents with that. I've always read a
      lot--I read every genre. While I feel very connected to places and some
      people, and those are all a fixed and essential part of my identity, I
      think many of the values I hold come mostly from the literature I love.
      The people around me taught me to find your passion, embrace challenge as
      a lifestyle, and engage emotionally with your life. My family have a range
      of experiences and perspectives, and I've always found myself to be the
      one people come talk to when they're in crisis or at a crossroads. I used
      to think they wanted help problem-solving, but have since learned a much
      more valuable role is that of the active listener. So that has become a
      part of my identity and it's something I value highly.</p> 
      
      <strong>Identify your
      strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong> 
      <p>I
      really love to learn. I'm curious about new challenges, and I don't find
      the not-knowing to be uncomfortable. I'm well-versed in the "human
      skills", and feel comfortable engaging with others. Problem solving is a
      passion of mine. I think this will be a strength that will help support my
      learning journey.</p> 
      
      <strong>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and
      career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong> 
      <p>I have
      been working on developing my patience. Historically, I have chosen to
      work on 'projects' as opposed to joining a career, because I find I can
      maintain my level of interest and motivation for long enough to sustain me
      through the project. It is something I'm working on, and it is another
      reason why I chose web development as a focus. It seems to be built into
      this area that there are constantly new things to learn, new problems to
      solve, and new ways to grow. I don't have a strong background in
      computer-related skills, and so developing those will take me a little
      time.</p> 
      
      <strong>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
      others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried
      at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.</strong> 
      
      <p>When I was completing the fieldwork
      for my PhD, I was working with the international parkour community on
      identifying a way to address the issue of misrepresentation of parkour
      outside the sport. This ended up being such a complicated and emotionally
      charged area that my fieldwork quickly became about a multitude of other
      facets. There was always tension when discussing what parkour really was,
      as the community itself was divided on how to practice parkour and where,
      as a sport, it was heading (for instance, some practitioners wanted to
      promote new "parkour competitions" to gain sponsorship and enable them to
      make parkour their career, and other practitioners eschewed all
      competition, as the founders of parkour were emphatic on the idea that
      parkour was always meant to be non-competitive). I discussed ways to
      represent the struggle within the community to the outside world,
      suggesting that the journey of the parkour community was a journey many
      people would identify with and understand. However it was a struggle to
      fit an appropriate application of our problem-identification into the
      timeframe of a PhD, although we did manage to make a short film following
      members of the Japanese parkour community through some of their personal
      struggles. Overall, I think I did well considering it was my first time
      acting as a facilitator to problem-solving for a group of people. However,
      I should have thought it out more ahead of time so I had options prepared
      in the moment. Allowing too much time to lapse between planning sessions
      meant we ran out of time on some of the more interesting ideas. Now, I
      would come up with a few "barebones" plans for how to implement that
      problem-solving, so that when the problems were identified we could launch
      straight into an action plan. I'm also more comfortable with the emotional
      aspect to problem-solving. I think it's important to allow space for those
      emotions, and allow them to act as signposts that guide the discovery and
      reflection aspects of problem-solving. So now, my approach would allow
      more dedicated space for the expression of emotional stories when in the
      problem-identification stage (this way everyone feels equally heard, and
      invested in the outcome). Use those emotions to facilitate a discussion
      about problem-solving. And then in the problem-solving stage, have some
      'barebones' plans for implementation that can be easily adapted to suit
      the community's interest or focus. That way I'm acting as a guide without
      overly influencing the direction.</p>
