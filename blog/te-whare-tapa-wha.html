    <p class="question">Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</p>
    <p>
      I've been on a bit of a wellbeing journey lately, and have spent some time
      figuring out a routine that works best for me. This currently looks like:
      <ul>
      <li>Daily walks with my dog (usually one hour in the morning)</li>
      <li>Daily training sessions with my dog (usually about a half hour in the afternoon)</li>
      <li>Several small stretch sessions throughout the day (weekdays), to combat stiffness from working at computer</li>
      <li>Strength workouts three times per week</li>
      <li>One weekly 2-3 hour hike, usually on the weekend (with family or friends)</li>
      <li>Working on getting better sleep habits (now my daughter is sleeping more regular hours)</li>
      <li>Keeping to a Mediterranean diet as much as possible (focus on heart health)</li>
      <li>Keeping up with basic health checks (dentist, doctor, etc)</li>
      </ul>
      This list is changing and expanding as I develop more of a sense of what works for my family and my current lifestyle. Freya (my daughter) is learning to swim, so we will be doing more swimming together. I would like to start training parkour again, especially as Freya grows older and is more capable of joining in.

    <p class="question">
    Taha WhƒÅnau (Family Wellbeing)
    </p> 
    <p>
      I want to spend more time focusing on these relationships. This area has always been very important to me, but in recent years I have slipped at it a bit.
      I would love to have a stronger sense of community here in Christchurch, as I intend to stay for a few years at least.
      I have always travelled a lot, and my friends are scattered all over the world. While travel is exciting, it does make for a fragmented community.
      My goals for developing a sense of familial wellbeing:
      <ul>
        <li>Continue building a strong foundation with my daughter</li>
        <li>Continue to be present for my immediate family (this is the main reason I originally moved back to New Zealand). Parents: visiting their land in Diamond Harbour, helping with the animals, assisting in their projects. Help support my sister (she is having another baby in September). Continue to be present with my brother, who is a great supporter of my web development journey (and is a great friend!)</li>
        <li>Put more effort into building my friend group, including making some Mama friends</li>
        <li>Strengthen relationships with my friends Rochelle and Jenn (make regular trips out to Sheffield to see Jenn, start regular urban agility training with Rochelle and the dogs)</li>
        <li>Work harder at engaging with the Dev Academy cohort, as a way to begin engaging with the tech community</li>
        <li>Reach out to friends abroad for more regular catch ups, including writing letters again!</li>
      </ul>
      I've noticed I slipped away from some regular contact once I had my daughter, as I suddenly had a lot less free time (and exhaustion has been pretty consistent for two years now).
      However, it's time to start putting more effort into this area of wellbeing.

    Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)
    </p> 
    <p>
      This is a challenging area for me, because I have always had a lot of anxiety.
      I have been working hard to develop greater defences against intrusive thoughts, and interrupting the cycle of anxiety.
      It's my belief this will be an ongoing focus in my life, although I have hope I'll feel on top of it someday.
      I think a stronger routine of wellbeing (as I'm listing in this blog post) will help to deal with this.
      Additionally:
      <ul>
        <li>Working hard to maintain relationships with people I love</li>
        <li>Giving my emotions time and space to 'have their say'</li>
        <li>Giving everyone more time and space in conversations, to strengthen relationships and have calmer, less rushed conversations</li>
        <li>Making time for meditation</li>
        <li>Spending as much time outside as possible each day</li>
        <li>Learning to ask for help when I need it. I've never learned how to do this properly. Learn now.</li>
        <li>Spend as much time as possible with Freya each day. Learn together about how to be emotionally resilient</li>
      </ul>
      This works feels really worthwhile, not only for myself but for my daughter. I want to do better, for her. The last two years have been 
      the most peaceful of my life, emotionally. Physically it has been hard to deal with the exhaustion and workload of being a single parent,
      but as a Mama I've found the confidence I've been wanting my whole life. So this might be the most challenging area for me, but I also feel
      capable of doing this work.

    <p class="question"> 
      Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)
    </p>
    <p>
      I wasn't sure what to write here at first. However, the description of wairua as "an internal connection to the universe or the sacred"
      hit me deeply. I feel that way when I connect with stories. I love to read; it has been one of the most profound passions in my life since I was a few years old.
      My earliest memories include reading stories with my Mom, and trying to teach myself to read looking through books.
      I think this is because every being on earth has a story, and I feel there is this incredible privelege and power to being able to access stories other than our own. Not only human stories either; we can learn about the lives of animals, plants, the earth itself. Everything is connected to its history, its nature, and its community. Everything has a story.
      <br>
      Engaging with stories (any writing--fiction, nonfiction, I read everything) is how I come to understand what I value, how I feel about others, how I explore the world.
      It is my oldest personal tradition, certainly, with many different rituals.
      <br>
      So in thinking about spiritual wellbeing, which I also connect deeply to nature and the environment (though I'm saving that for the following paragraph),
      I think about how I feel connecting with stories. They are our way of making sense of ourselves, of our place in the world. They support us when we are heartbroken or lonely, join us in celebration and joy, or help guide us when we seek answers.
      The impulse to tell stories is one way I understand humanity, and find it a meaningful way to strengthen my own spiritual wellbeing.

      Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment) 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am naturally really connected to the natural environment. I think more clearly outside, feel generally calmer and more capable.
      Given a choice, I would be outside all day long. I chose to focus on parkour training for my PhD because it allowed me to spend the better part of four years running around outside in different environments.
      Every place I have lived, I remember most clearly by some place outside that became deeply meaningful to me. Those sense memories are firmly rooted in who I am today.
      <ul>
        <li>I work in my garden, growing a lot of the food my family eats. This is so cathartic. I love the smell of growing things (and they taste better too!).</li>
        <li>Caring for the animals on the land in Diamond Harbour (the alpaca herd, ducks, chickens, and the dogs). I've always found animals to be a calming presence, and caring for them helps me feel a stronger bond to our role in the wider ecosystem.</li>
        <li>My daughter and I spend time outside every evening before settling in for the night, and I hope this continues as a way to connect to each other. At the moment, we talk about the plants we're growing, and often run laps around our yard or walk together.</li>
        <li>We live near the beach, and spend a lot of time there. The fresh smell of the air at the sea is something I will never tire of. Also my dog likes to chase sticks.</li>
        <li>I have a goal this year to begin doing longer hikes with my daughter; as she builds her strength and endurance, we can build up to full day hikes! The dream: a long-haul hike together, like the Te Araroa trail.</li>
        <li>When it rains, my daughter and I like to sit under our awning and watch. I hope it snows this year, and she can see how beautiful snow can be.</li>
      </ul>
      I think some people are just naturally drawn to the natural environment. This area is a strong part of my sense of wellbeing.
