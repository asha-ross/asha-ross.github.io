    Wall Activities Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing) e.g. going for a swim
    before class 2 x a week Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing) Taha tinana is your
    physical wellbeing. It is about how your body grows, feels and moves, and
    how you care for it. Nourishing and strengthening your physical wellbeing
    helps you to cope with the ups and downs and life. Feeling physically well
    helps you feel mentally well. Some key things to take care of taha tinana
    are physical activity, healthy eating, and good sleep hygiene.

    Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing) e.g. having dinner with my family every
    evening Taha Whānau (family wellbeing) Taha whānau is about who makes you
    feel like you belong, who you care about and who you share your life with.
    Whānau is about extended relationships – it’s not just your immediate
    relatives, it’s your friends, hoamahi (colleagues), community and the people
    you care about. Everyone has a place and a role to fulfil within their
    whānau, and whānau contributes to your individual wellbeing and identity.
    Spending time with whānau, doing things for them and getting involved gives
    you a feeling of purpose, connection and wellbeing. It benefits you and
    strengthens your whānau. As a core source of strength, support, security and
    identity, whānau plays a central role in your wellbeing.

    Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing) e.g. listening to a guided
    meditation before sleep Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing) Taha
    hinengaro is your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts and feelings. It’s about
    how you feel, as well as how you communicate and think. Taking care of taha
    hinengaro is important for everyone, regardless of whether or not you’ve
    experienced mental illness or distress. The foods we eat can affect our
    mental health, physical activity can reduce symptoms of stress and anxiety,
    and learning how to manage stress before it gets overwhelming are all ways
    to support taha hinengaro.

    Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing) e.g. praying or making time to express
    gratitude each day Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing) The way people view
    wairua can be very different. For some, wairua is the capacity for faith or
    religious beliefs or having a belief in a higher power. For others, wairua
    is an internal connection to the universe or the sacred. There is no right
    or wrong way to think of or experience wairua, but it is an important part
    of your mental wellbeing. Spiritual wellbeing can be expressed through
    beliefs, values, traditions and practices that support self-awareness and
    identity. Taha wairua provides a sense of meaning and purpose as well as
    experiencing a sense of connectedness to self, whānau, community, nature and
    the sacred.

    Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment) e.g. walking on the
    grass barefoot once a week Whenua (land) As the foundation for the other 4
    dimensions, the health of the land and the natural environment is strongly
    connected to your health and wellbeing. You can think about whenua as your
    place of belonging. For Māori, the whenua is a key part of identity.
    Connection to the land and to nature has been shown to improve mental and
    physical wellbeing. When was the last time you took a moment to enjoy
    nature? Not just the bush, mountains or beach but the small, everyday
    wonders all around us – the rustling of the wind through the trees, the
    spring flowers or the sound of birds settling for the night. Read our top
    tips for letting nature in to strengthen your wellbeing. Maybe one of these
    will be your small step to greater wellbeing through whenua.
