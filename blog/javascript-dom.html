    <h1>Javascript and the DOM</h1>
    <p class="question">
      Analogy of the relationship between Javascript, HTML, and CSS
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been thinking for some time about the relationship between
      Javascript, the DOM, HTML, and CSS, and I think I have an analogy that
      works well. Consider this relationship as a library.</p>

     <p> The HTML provides the architecture blueprint of the library. It dictates
      the structure, the layout, and is the essential foundation upon which the library functions. </p>
      <p>CSS is in charge of the ambiance, the style of the space, and every design feature that enhances the experience of using the library, from an aesthetic point of view.</p>
      
      <p>JavaScript, in this analogy, is represented by the books themselves. This is where the information and interaction lives. It is where all the logic and functionality is within the library.
    </p> 
      
      <p>Finally, the DOM can be seen as the librarian. It is the system that manages, organises, and retrieves information. All together, these elements enable interaction with information, through structure, styling, and management of that information.</p>

    <p class="question">
      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
      life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </p>
    <p class="question">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</p>
