    <h1>Javascript and the DOM</h1>
    <p class="question">
      Welcome to Javascript!
    </p>
    <p>
      So you're learning Javascript. Greetings! It's going to be a ride.
      <br>
      Javascript is a language, a way of creating interactions on your web page and in your code. 
      I have been thinking for some time about the relationship between
      Javascript, the DOM, HTML, and CSS, and I think I have an analogy that
      works well. Consider this relationship as a library.</p>

      <figure class="image-container">
        <img
          id="library"
          src="../assets/francesca-grima-ln_slYqaMiI-unsplash.jpg"
          alt="a beautiful library"
        />

      </figure>
      <div class="box-of-words">
     <p> Consider, if you will, the library in all its complexity: it is a repository of books and information, a building, a meeting place, and it is its people.
      The HTML represents the architecture blueprint of the library. It dictates
      the structure, the layout, and is the essential foundation upon which the library functions. HTML determines the shelving system, and how all the other aspects of the library interact with one another through space. </p>
      <p>CSS, then, is ithe ambiance, the style of the space. Every design feature that enhances the experience of using the library, from an aesthetic point of view, relates to CSS.</p>
      
      <p>JavaScript, in this analogy, is represented by the books themselves. This is where the information and interaction lives. It is where all the logic and functionality is within the library.
        That means it is the essence of what draws people to interact with the space, into the library.
      </p> 
      
      <p>Finally, the DOM can be seen as the librarian. It is the system that manages, organises, and retrieves information. 
        All together, these elements enable interaction with information, through structure, styling, and management of that information.</p> 
        I think this analogy works reasonably well to discuss the relationship between all these parts of web development.
    </p></div>
    <p class="question">
      Control flow and loops (using an example process from everyday
      life).
    </p>
    <p>I have to admit to finding this challenging to conceptualise, but I'll have a go.
      Control flow is the order in which instructions are executed in a script. It means dictating how the code flows through conditions and loops, etc. 
      In the context of everyday life, I would say this is like following a recipe for making food, something that you do every day. Control flow is following the steps in a strict order, and loops are those specific steps that execute a particular action in a particular way.
    Javascript as a language is built around these instructions; loops, conditionals, arrays etc all determine how information is presented and interacted with, all the rules that structure the interactive elements of your document, are expressed through these aspects of Javascript.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </p>
    <p>I included the DOM in my analogy above, and so I will just explain it in that context. I was envisioning the DOM as a librarian: the person in charge of managing a system of information. They interact with the structure, use the styling, and access the information to deliver an experience.
      You can interact with the DOM in several ways, one of which is using Javascript through methods identified here:
      <figure class="image-container">
        <img
          id="screenshot-element"
          src="../assets/screenshot-example-HTMLelement.png"
          alt="a screenshot of Javascript accessing the DOM"
        />
        <figcaption class="image-caption">
          An example of a Javascript directive accessing the DOM
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
     Using methods such as "getElementById" (or "getElementsByClassName", "getElementsByTagName, "querySelector" and so on) in JavaScript, you are interacting directly with the DOM to make something happen.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are both important structures within Javascript, but act slightly differently.
      <br> 
      An array is an ordered collection, and looks like this:
      <figure class="image-container">
        <img
        id="screenshot-array"
          src="../assets/screenshot-arrays.png"
          alt="a screenshot of an array"
        />
        <figcaption class="image-caption">
          An example of Arrays, and accessing the array
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      To access the data in an array, you need to 'call' a particular number in the array to use that information. The information is ordered through a numerical index starting at '0'. This is represented above using the square brackets.      
      Arrays are useful when you need information to be accessed or presented in a specific sequence. That is essential about an array: the order they are written in matters.
    </p>
       <p>
        An object is a key connected to its values. That means they are specific (the key is unique), though values are not. See below:
        <figure class="image-container">
          <img
            id="screenshot-object"
            src="../assets/screenshot-objects.png"
            alt="a screenshot of example objects"
          />
          <figcaption class="image-caption">
            An example of Objects
          </figcaption>
        </figure>    
        To access the data in an object, you need to use dot notation, as detailed in the following image:
     
     <figure class="image-container">
      <img
      id="screenshot-access-object"
        src="../assets/screenshot-access-object.png"
        alt="accessing object"
      />
      <figcaption class="image-caption">
        An example of Accessing Objects
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    You would use Objects in your code when you have data that requires a specific property (such as a name, price, etc).
  </p>
    <p class="question">Functions, and why they are helpful</p>
    <figure class="image-container">
      <img
      id="screenshot-function"
        src="../assets/screenshot-function.png"
        alt="a screenshot of an example of a function"
      />
      <figcaption class="image-caption">
        An example of a Function (including comments)
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Functions are one of the foundations of Javascript. They perform tasks.
      Moreover, functions provide the modular structure that is so useful to Javascript. You can ensure your code is strong, elegant, and reliable through creating modular components that can be reused.
      Functions perform a specific task. Because you can reuse them throughout your code, you can enhance functionality through reducing redundancy. This is particularly important when your code becomes more complex.
      <br>
      To be effective with declaring a function, you need to think simply about <i>what it has to do</i>.
      <br>
      In the following example, the function is checking through a list of products to see if the stock is at 0. 
      If it is, the function triggers a following function that will restock those products.
      <figure class="image-container">
        <img
        id="screenshot-function-example2"
          src="../assets/screenshot-function-example2.png"
          alt="a screenshot of a second example of a function"
        />
        <figcaption class="image-caption">
          An example of a function that restocks products if the stock number is at 0
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br>
      Functions require simple and clear naming conventions (these should explain what that function does--as above, the function name is "restock"). 
      The parameters of the function are placeholders for specific values that will be inserted when the function is called. 
      <br>
      Within the function, you identify what the function should do (as above, the function checks if the product === (exactly equals) 0).
      <br>
      At any point in your code once this function has been defined, you are able to call that function so the defined action (and output) happens.
      <br>
      Though functions can certainly seem complex, particularly once you start adding loops, conditionals, and so forth, but they are an essential structure to working in Javascript and henceforth worth the effort in learning to use them.
