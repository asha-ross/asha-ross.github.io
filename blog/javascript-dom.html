    <h1>Javascript and the DOM</h1>
    <p class="question">
      Analogy of the relationship between Javascript, HTML, and CSS
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been thinking for some time about the relationship between
      Javascript, the DOM, HTML, and CSS, and I think I have an analogy that
      works well. Consider this relationship as a library.</p>

     <p> The HTML provides the architecture blueprint of the library. It dictates
      the structure, the layout, and is the essential foundation upon which the library functions. </p>
      <p>CSS is in charge of the ambiance, the style of the space, and every design feature that enhances the experience of using the library, from an aesthetic point of view.</p>
      
      <p>JavaScript, in this analogy, is represented by the books themselves. This is where the information and interaction lives. It is where all the logic and functionality is within the library.
    </p> 
      
      <p>Finally, the DOM can be seen as the librarian. It is the system that manages, organises, and retrieves information. All together, these elements enable interaction with information, through structure, styling, and management of that information.</p>

    <p class="question">
      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
      life.
    </p>
    <p>I have to admit to finding this challenging to conceptualise, but I'll have a go.
      Control flow is the order in which things are executed in a script. It means dictating how the code flows through conditions and loops, etc. 
      In the context of everyday life, I would say this is like following a recipe for making food, something that you do every day. Control flow is following the steps in a strict order, and loops are those specific steps that execute a particular action in a particular way.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </p>
    <p>I included the DOM in my analogy above, and so I may just explain it in that context. I was envisioning the DOM as a librarian: the person in charge of managing a system of information. They interact with the structure, use the styling, and access the information to deliver an experience.</p>
    <p class="question">
      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </p>
    <p>Accessing data from an array is fairly simple: you need to call a particular number in the array to use that information, using an index.
      To access the data in an object, you need to use dot notation.
    </p>
    <p class="question">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</p>
