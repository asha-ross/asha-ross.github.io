    <h1>Technical Blog</h1>
    <p>
      This is where I will be writing about a technical thing. One of these
      things: What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? What
      are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids? What are the
      differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning? What does
      it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?
