      <h1><strong>Best Practice for Classes and Id</strong></h1>
      <p>What are the best practices for using classes and ids?</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Classes and ids are used to apply something specific to an element.
        <br />
        This could be a style (font, colour, border, padding, and the list goes
        on), or another trait.
        <img
          class="screenshot1"
          alt="a screenshot of class styles"
          src="../assets/class_style_examples.png"
        />
      </p>
      <br />

        <strong>What is a class?</strong>
        A class is a way to add a specific trait to multiple elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best practice for using "class" is when you are applying a trait that
        can be used by multiple elements. CSS relies on classes to maintain
        consistency throughout your document and across the styling. Typically
        all styling is done using classes, in an effort to maintain consistency
        at scale as well as within the page.
      </p>
      <img
        class="screenshot2"
        alt="a screenshot of class example"
        src="../assets/class_container.png"
      />
      <p>
        In CSS, you would target a class by using " . ", for example: .class
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>What is an Id?</strong>
        An id is a way to add a specific trait to a specific element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best practice for ids is for that specific element (used once per
        document). Additionally, best practice suggests avoiding styling
        directly with an id, and instead using ids for more specific JavaScript
        information. However, if you want to add specific styling to a singular
        element, you can use the ID to target it.
      </p>
      <img
        class="screenshot3"
        alt="a screenshot of an id example"
        src="../assets/id_books.png"
      />
      <p>In CSS, you would target an id by using " # ", for example: #id</p>
      <p>
        Following this best practice means your code will be more elegant and
        readable, as well as more manageable.
