    <title>Neuroplasticity</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is changing how we think about the brain and its ability
      to change and heal. Our previous mentality has considered the brain as
      being in a fixed state; this meant that once damaged, the brain would
      always be damaged. However, research in neuroscience and associated
      disciplines has demonstrated that the brain is not only able to heal, but
      to develop new pathways, strengthen, and fundamentally change. The
      benefits to understanding neuroplasticity are staggering. More than ever
      before, self-awareness and understanding of how the brain functions can
      lead people to develop skills and abilities beyond what we once thought
      possible.

      Grasping the fundamentals of neuroplasticity means developing a
      self-awareness which greatly strengthens the learning process. In the
      context of my benefit, particularly in this latest learning environment,
      this means I can be strategic about how I go about learning coding and the
      languages of web development. One of these techniques is incorporating the
      mental practice as well as the physical act of coding. I will be setting
      aside time each day to “quiz” myself on a small aspect of code (while
      learning Javascript, for instance, that will be mini-quizzes throughout
      the day about definitions and when to use certain types of methods,
      conditionals, loops etc, as well as taking plain-English statements and
      figuring out how to express them through Javascript). These exercises are
      fun and lighthearted, but also speak to the importance of regular mental
      exercises as well as regular physical coding time at the computer. This
      combination of practice is one way to enhance my own neuroplasticity. I
      also intend to revisit challenges/problems that I’ve done previously to
      see if I can find new ways to solve familiar problems.

      I have really enjoyed Norman Doidge's work, both the Brain that Changes
      Itself and the Brain's Way of Healing. He writes beautifully about
      neuroplasticity, which his background in philosophy really accentuates. I
      also like Oliver Sacks' work, though he's more of a neurologist. These
      explorations of the brain are fascinating. I wish I had more time to
      really dive into neuroscience, I love it.

      Growth Mindset: Discuss what it is and why it is relevant: The growth
      mindset is seeing yourself as a changing, learning being throughout your
      life. Self-awareness is also relevant to this area, in that a useful
      perspective of the self is one of adaptability and flexibility, as opposed
      to thinking “I just am the way I am” when it comes to learning. It’s also
      possible to reframe how we conceive of different personality traits and
      their usefulness within learning. This goes for so-called ‘positive’
      traits as well. Anything fixed will ultimately have a limit of its
      usefulness.

      I've enjoyed this exploration, because I like this area of inquiry a lot.
      I'm finding new ways to integrate this way of thinking in how I'm
      approaching learning a new set of skills. I'm trying to remind myself of
      them especially when things are challenging. I have written down phrases
      about growth mindset and neuroplasticity, and I have them posted around my
      work station. I'm also trying to revisit some of my notes about both
      growth mindset and neuroplasticity at least once a week. It's just helpful
      to have those thoughts in my head when I'm approaching the new challenges
      each week!

      I have been researching growth mindset in the context of action research strategies. I used the action research strategy in my PhD and still do Google Scholar searches to keep up with the research. There are a number of interesting dissertations published in the last few years in this area, I've been enjoying reading them all. It's particularly interesting to see how much the growth mindset has been impacting how we study the efficacy of education and learning environments.

      Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
      learning plan and strategy. <br />
      As stated above, I'm revisiting my notes frequently and trying to remind
      myself that what is challenging now is something I can adapt to. I'm also
      trying to do both mental exercises as well as the physical coding
      practice, so that I'm using different avenues of my brain.
