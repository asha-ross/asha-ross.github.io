              I started this learning adventure
              thinking (privately) that I already understood what the core
              learning would be about. I was sure that because I had gone
              through challenging learning environments before, I knew (more or
              less) what this part of the course would be about. That's not to
              say I didn't go through the exercises; I just had an idea that I
              already knew what they'd be teaching me.
              <br />
              <br />
              Cue laughter.
              <br />
              <br />
              Because it turns out, in the context of coding, the core skills
              have a completely different role than I've experienced before. I
              have never experienced such a useful core learning aspect to a
              learning environment. And at each new stage, I am confronted with
              how much I am relying on those skills.
              <br />
              Three specific things I've learned about myself (and my ego):
              <br>
              <ol>
                <li>I always have more to learn, about everything. There are always nuances to experience, to skills, and to context.</li>
                <li>When my instinct is to race ahead, out of excitement or eagerness, what I most need to do is slow down.</li>
                <li>I am capable of learning new things, and I love that. I thought coding was scary; I am having so much fun!</li>
              </ol>

              What surprised me most about the core learning in Foundations is how useful it is in the context of learning programming.
              I found that I relied heavily on it to build my resilience and patience for acquiring the new language, and the change in perspective needed for coding.
              There is a lot more for me to learning about these core skills, and while I have some of them, there are still challenges there.
              The most challenging thing for me was <i>pacing</i> myself, and dealing with the complex kinds of frustrating engendered by learning these new languages.
              It honestly surprised me that the core skills were delivered in such a useful way alongside the technical skills. I think in previous learning and working environments, 
              I've experienced core skills delivered in a more... perfunctory sense. Like a <i>nod</i> towards their importance as opposed to a genuine understanding of their role.
              I really value that about the Dev Academy experience.

              What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
              learning and programming?
              A lot of self-awareness comes into play in this learning environment.

              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
              time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
              course? Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel
              like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
              practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
