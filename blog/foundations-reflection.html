              I started this learning adventure
              thinking (privately) that I already understood what the core
              learning would be about. I was sure that because I had gone
              through challenging learning environments before, I knew (more or
              less) what this part of the course would be about. That's not to
              say I didn't go through the exercises; I just had an idea that I
              already knew what they'd be teaching me.
              <br />
              <br />
              Cue laughter.
              <br />
              <br />
              Because it turns out, in the context of coding, the core skills
              have a completely different role than I've experienced before. I
              have never experienced such a useful core learning aspect to a
              learning environment. And at each new stage, I am confronted with
              how much I am relying on those skills.
              <br />
              Three specific things I've learned about myself (and my ego):
              <br>
              <ol>
                <li>I always have more to learn, about everything. There are always nuances to experience, to skills, and to context.</li>
                <li>When my instinct is to race ahead, out of excitement or eagerness, what I most need to do is slow down.</li>
                <li>I am capable of learning new things, and I love that. I thought coding was scary; I am having so much fun!</li>
              </ol>

              What surprised me most about the core learning in Foundations is how useful it is in the context of learning programming.
              I found that I relied heavily on it to build my resilience and patience for acquiring the new language, and the change in perspective needed for coding.
              There is a lot more for me to learning about these core skills, and while I have some of them, there are still challenges there.
              The most challenging thing for me was <i>pacing</i> myself, and dealing with the complex kinds of frustrating engendered by learning these new languages.
              It honestly surprised me that the core skills were delivered in such a useful way alongside the technical skills. I think in previous learning and working environments, 
              I've experienced core skills delivered in a more... perfunctory sense. Like a <i>nod</i> towards their importance as opposed to a genuine understanding of their role.
              I really value that about the Dev Academy experience.

          <strong>Values, Empathy, and Self-Awareness</strong>

              A lot of self-awareness comes into play in this learning environment. It humbles you, and I think that exercise alongside learning creates an opportunity for personal growth.
              I think that understanding your personal values can sometimes inspire empathy, especially working alongside others like this. Understanding where someone is coming from helps to contextualise their problem-solving process, and makes working with them easier. 
              In short, I think that values, empathy, and self-awareness are deeply entwined in the learning process. Something like this bootcamp environment enhances their impact, and with a focus on building associated skills (like listening!), they're all being strengthened simulatenously.

              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
              time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
              course? Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel
              like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
              practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

              I think the emphasis on core learning has come clearer throughout Foundations for me, and I wholeheartedly support the balanced learning in Dev Academy. I think it's a smart approach to a pressured learning environment, which I suspect mirrors the type of work environment that can exist in Tech.
              I have found the core learning to be incredibly useful, as I found a lot of my instinctual behaviours were not making learning as easy as it could have been. Core learning drew that to my attention, and I'm having a much easier time now!
              I think that it would be a mistake to focus too intensely on acquiring tech skills -- the break, and refocus on core skills each week, has also given me time to work on those tech skills in a 'mental practice' sense, which means I'm actually learning faster anyway.
              Basically, I've been really impressed with how Dev Academy is constructed and am finding it a really positive learning environment.
