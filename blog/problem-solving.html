          <br />Simple Problems.
          <p class="paragraph-card">
            Everything in coding, so far, has been a simple problem. In fact,
            the simpler it is the more often I have stumbled on it. Somehow, I
            seem to forget this at each new threshold. The simplest problems are
            often difficult because of their very nature: they are so simple,
            that I assume that answer can't be the right one. Instead of simply
            trying the simplest answer first and then progressing to more
            complexities if that doesn't work, I often try to be clever and leap
            ahead.
            <br />
            This is the least clever thing you can do. Enter, the five stages of
            grieving, code edition.
            <br />
            The simple problem that recently tripped me up was trying to figure
            out how to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string of
            words. This sounds like it should be simple, but I was stuck on it
            for
            <i>awhile</i>. This is because I couldn't figure out how to isolate
            only the first letter of each word, and not every word, or only the
            first letter of the sentence... It went on and on. I think I went
            through every possibility of capitalization before realising I had
            to give some instruction to the other letters in the word, not only
            the first.
            <br />
            SIGH.
            <br />
            Instead of calmly redirecting to other problem-solving techniques, I
            went through denail, rage, bargaining, and despondency before I
            tried the most obvious solution, which worked. I find the incident
            humourous when I look back on it, because I think what was wrong was
            that I was tired and hungry, and therefore responding emotionally
            instead of logically. I learned I can learn a lot from the human
            skills component of this course, and those are the modules I need to
            remind myself of most throughout my coding adventure.
            <br />
            The technical knowledge comes a lot easier when I regard each step
            as equally important to the process.

          Elegant Solutions.
          <p class="paragraph-card">
            As I progressed through the Javascript Kata in this part of the
            course, I found myself becoming... well, a more elegant
            problem-solver. It's a heady feeling, really. I found that giving
            myself a little more space before solving each problem allowed me
            room to consider the simplest solution, but also gave me time to
            reason whether it would work.
            <br />
            More importantly, I started using console.log() a lot more
            frequently, and to better effect. What a tool this is!
            <br />
            I began to experience this feeling of elegance during the Where Are
            You? kata challenge. I was able to slow down, and took more time to
            research the method first. I checked multiple sources, including MDN
            and a few others. This ensured I understood how the method really
            functioned. This meant when I began to use it in my code, I knew
            what needed to go where. Moreover, when I was constructing the
            function I remembered the type of object I was working with, and
            what I needed to identify. Finally, I was able to construct the code
            on one line, eliminating redundancies.
            <br />
            I found it deeply calming as an experience. I think I was rushing
            too much before. Perhaps I've been feeling pressured by time
            constraints (even though I've done well at time management, having a
            deadline always makes me feel a little pressure. This is not
            necessarily a bad thing, but something I need to get better at
            managing emotionally). However, I think it has finally sunk in that
            the slower I go initially, the easier the entire experience is.

          Problem Solving Techniques
          <p class="paragraph-card">
            I think I have found a way to use these techniques to help me become
            a more confident, and more elegant programmer.
            <br />
            <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> this has been a really helpful tool,
            and one I am getting used to using. I've been using it to first
            write out what I need to do, and then include points on what I'm
            learning or how I'm using it. This is great for learning. Later,
            I'll probably just use it to write out what each line will do/should
            do.
            <br />
            <strong>Trying something:</strong> This has been both positive and a
            bit of a crutch for me. I keep 'trying something' because I am
            hoping to remember what I've learned, but I think I need to limit
            myself to how many 'somethings' I try before moving to a different
            technique!
            <br />
            <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> This really works! I've been
            explaining things to my dog, who usually sits at my side while I am
            coding. He's a smart dog, but computers are a bit outside his realm
            of expertise. So I try to explain what I want to do at each line
            (usually I couple this with pseudocode) and it helps me to simplify
            what I intend to do. This actually addresses one of the major
            problems I've been having all along: that of unnecessarily
            overcomplicating my coding. When I explain it simply, and out loud,
            I am reminded to try the simpler thing first.
            <br />
            <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> I'm still learning how to
            do this, but it's also a great tool. Sometimes the error messages
            are not that helpful, but for the most part I'm starting to figure
            out what they all mean. It's another part of the language.
            <br />
            <strong>Console.logging:</strong> I think I have terribly
            underestimated what a tool this is. I seem to have crossed a
            threshold this Sprint, where I'm no longer fighting the syntax as
            much, and instead using all the tools and seeing the structure of
            the language. It's such a delight. Console logging is one of those
            things I now see as supremely useful. My first step at each new
            stage now is to console.log and see what I'm working with. Then
            throughout, I use it to establish what I need to write next.
            <br />
            <strong>Googling:</strong> I think I've figured out exactly
            <i>how</i> I should use this during this most recent Sprint. The
            'research' part of this sprint really drove it home, and I now have
            a routine at each new stage which is going a lot smoother. I
            research the method (or whatever) I'm using, see how it works, and
            then start to implement in my code. There are a few sites in
            particular that are helpful in understanding JS structure (MDN, W3
            School, and Stack Overflow).
            <br />
            <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> I have been relying on
            my brother, who is a developer, but starting to interact more with
            my peers in the Dev Academy cohort, and I'm enjoying that too. It's
            nice to have other people along for the same ride. I probably need
            to do this more though!
            <br />
            <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I'm still getting used to
            this, honestly! I think I will be relying on them more in Bootcamp,
            when things are more intense. I will make an effort to use the
            facilitators and help desk more as I move forward, although so far I
            haven't had too many problems that I'm stuck on for a long time (the
            other problem solving techniques are working!)
            <br />
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> I have a
            suspicion that this is one of the main reasons why I feel I've
            crossed a bit of a threshold this week. I've been spending more time
            in the evenings going over notes I've made. I've created some
            flashcards of the aspects of Javascript we'll need in Bootcamp
            (there's a list in the student handbook I used to create the first
            set), and they've been really useful. I'm also adding to them as I
            find things that work in JS throughout the challenges. It is SO fun
            to learn new things.

          Reluctance...
          <p class="paragraph-card">
            Reflecting on a time I was reluctant to ask for help... Well, I've
            considered that in the context of the questions about how much/how
            well I've been using the different problem solving techniques in
            this course, and I realise I have not been utilizing the
            facilitators/help desk as much as I might. I think this is probably
            because I'm used to working on a project alone, and this is
            definitely a habit I need to break. I did have a moment earlier this
            week where I was stuck and posting it to the helpdesk occured to me.
            I think what held me back was the desire to go back through what I'd
            done and see if I could figure it out myself. It did take awhile,
            but I probably could have cut that time in half by just asking for
            guidance. I consider it a personal challenge to engage more on the
            helpdesk Discord when I have these issues. I know it's something
            that will come in handy as we progress through Bootcamp.
