    <h1>Thinking about my learning plan...</h1>
    <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
    <p>
      My long-term career goals are centred around flexibility and intellectual
      stimulation. I am a single Mama, and being present for my daughter as she
      grows up is paramount. To that end, I believe working in the tech sector
      will allow me to build flexibility into my work schedule. By this I mean
      having some ability to work remotely when needed, and to work on projects
      as opposed to just putting in a 9-5. I also want to work at solving
      problems so that my work feels useful and meaningful, as well as
      intellectually stimulating. I am a hard worker, but I struggle to stay
      engaged if I don’t have any room to grow. I’m excited to be developing
      skills that will allow me to work hard at something I’m invested in.

    <strong>My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</strong>
    <p>
      I love to learn. I enjoy the challenges that come with it, and I’m
      comfortable being in a state of not-knowing. I like research, and I’m
      experienced at the learning process. My limitations are mostly about time
      and focus at the moment, as I adjust to my role as a working parent.
      However, that just takes time, and I feel confident in my ability to find
      a way to make it work for us.

      >What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
    >
    <p>
      I want to develop confidence with operating in the tech sector, as I build
      up a stock of technical skills. I want to feel confident navigating a new
      arena, including working with a team on a project. This is an entirely new
      area for me, and I'm interested in how different the collaboration will
      be.

      will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong
    >
    <p>
      I have made the commitment to entering this career path, and that means
      growing into a role within it. I intend to bring my existing skillset to
      the role, and work hard at learning new things. I've established a routine
      to clear space throughout the week, and I feel excited about learning.
      This means I'm happy to put in more hours as needed, in evenings and on
      weekends, to make it happen. I've experienced heavy workloads and
      deadlines before, and I always make it work. If I hit the wall, I'm really
      comfortable asking for help or support from the team too.
    </p>

      >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
      way</strong
    >
    <p>
      I really do appreciate the emphasis on seeking help in a timely matter —
      because I’m dealing with a limited amount of free time, I am committed to
      solving problems I’m having within a set timeframe. I feel comfortable
      asking the facilitators for help through the Discord group, and phrasing
      the issues I’m having in a way that the help will also be relevant to
      others. It is a system that seems to work pretty seamlessly. I also have
      access to a family member who works as a front-end developer for a big
      tech company, and he has been acting as an informal mentor. I think
      between the two I’ll be able to address any issues that arise.
    </p>
    <strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong>
    I am hoping the facilitation team are there for the support I’ll undoubtedly
    need as we progress to more complex information! So far everyone has been
    very supportive. By support, I mean being available to answer questions and
    offer explanations for things that are confusing me, or directing me to
    where the information is. I also appreciate that there is some existing
    understanding about the challenges of parenting while studying (more for
    reassurance than anything!). My hope is that if I’m missing something, the
    facilitation team will draw my attention to it so I can address it early.

    <p>
      I am a single Mama, and therefore have a number of childcare obligations.
      I have set aside blocks of time each week where my daughter is in
      preschool (9am to 2pm, three days a week), and have arranged with her
      grandparents to have regular care on the other two days (for a similar
      block of time). That means I should have a consistent block of time
      available for work, plus additional time in the evenings if I need more.
      That means I am busy doing school drop-off and pick-up at 8:45am, and 2pm
      on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
