        <p>
          I've been thinking a lot about what I want out of this new area of
          study, as I really settle into learning to code. My long term goals,
          particularly in relation to a career, are becoming clearer to me.
          <br />
          I particularly enjoy the problem-solving nature of programming, and I
          love the marriage of creativity and logic at its heart. It just feels
          like such a perfect way to contextualise the skills I already have
          from my previous studies. My long-term goal is to develop the
          technical and core skills I need to do web development and coding as
          both a career and <strong>for personal projects</strong>. I have many
          projects I would like to build, and these skills gives me a whole new
          way to explore them. For instance, I have always loved to write
          stories and am invested in both world-building and character
          development as a creative endeavour. These skills let me think about
          storytelling in a new medium, which is allowing me to reconstruct how
          I approach it to begin with. It's very exciting!
          <br />
          In terms of <strong>a career</strong>, I want to find something
          challenging and creative that gives me some flexibility in terms of
          parenting and home life. I hope to join a company initially, one that
          allows me to build my skills and confidence. I'm committed to finding
          something as soon as possible upon finishing at Dev Academy. I'm
          hoping to <strong>use these skills from Dev Academy</strong> to
          support my daughter and build projects with real meaning for myself
          and the community. I am passionate about community, and have always
          intended to find a career that allows me to make some positive change.
          <br />
          I don't have a specific company I am aiming at yet, but I will begin
          that search soon. I'd like to start brainstorming how these skills
          would be useful to community development projects.
          <br />
          In terms of <strong>strengths and weaknesses</strong> in Bootcamp, I
          have a clearer idea now, after Foundations. I think my love of
          learning is still a great asset. I feel enthusiastic and energised by
          this experience. My weakness is probably either time constraints or
          that I am still learning how to pace myself properly, which sometimes
          leads me to race ahead and then have to backtrack. However the more
          challenging nature of the work so far has forced me to slow down, so
          that will likely continue.
          <br />
          I do not think that focus is a problem any longer for me, as I have
          had the chance now to experience what coding for 20+ hours a week is
          like. I know I will be able to adjust. I worry about unforeseen
          complications (for instance, if my daughter is ill and can't go to
          school) but I will find a way to deal with them as they arise. I feel
          confident in my ability to do so.
          <br />
          New weaknesses I have already alluded to -- the fact that I still have
          an impulse to race ahead when I find a challenge interesting, but I am
          consistently reminding myself to take things step by step, and when
          working in a team or pair I think I will be better at adjusting this.
          <br />
          I think my experience so far in Foundations suggest I will adapt to
          Bootcamp! I understand that the learning pace is different, that the
          expectations are higher and the output more intense. However, I do
          have a great deal of trust in the Dev Academy facilitators to help
          support where we need it, and their judgment on what is an appropriate
          workload for those with other important commitments. I believe it's
          going to be a great experience.
          <br />
          The biggest <strong>non-technical challenge</strong> I expect to face
          is balancing working in a pair and controlling my own anxiety, which
          often leads me to 'deep dive' into something until I feel calmer. This
          is usually why I race ahead, although I'm getting better at the whole
          thing. I have some social anxiety, which is why the challenge of
          <strong>listening and looping</strong> was one of my favourites. It
          was so useful because I have the tendency to 'fill gaps' in a
          conversation out of anxiety, and this made me slow down. I have been
          using these skills in everyday life since learning them and am most
          impressed. It makes a huge difference to my anxiety and my
          relationships. <br />
          I want to get even better at this skill, learning to slow down in
          conversation and be more present. Because this is in part caused by
          anxiety it is helping me to deal with that too. I think I would like
          to feel really confident working in a group, and this is something Dev
          Academy seems to focus on a lot. I'm excited to do this, as all my
          projects to date have largely been driven by myself. I have, of
          course, worked with others before, but not quite like Pair Programming
          (for example). I've been so grateful for how thoughtfully the program
          has been developed; the mix of technical and core has been really well
          thought out. I feel like I'm making positive personal changes
          alongside developing really useful technical skills. I had no idea
          that the learning environment would be like this, but I feel a great
          amount of gratitude.
          <br />
          <br />
          My <strong>expectations of the Bootcamp team</strong> are just to
          continue being supportive in the same way as in Foundations. I really
          appreciate that I am able to ask any question without feeling shy
          about whether it's a 'good' question or not. I appreciate that there's
          always a team there to have my back. And I have experienced a great
          deal of support and understanding when my life threw curveballs and I
          had a week where it was harder to balance everything. I hope that this
          continues in Bootcamp. Just knowing the facilitators are available is
          actually enough most of the time. The
          <strong>expectations I have of myself</strong> are to really absorb
          all the teaching (especially in the human skills area).
          <br />
          My knowledge of Bootcamp so far is that the learning pace increases
          exponentially, and the format is more structured. I am trying to
          regularly reach out to the Helpdesk when I have questions in
          anticipation of Bootcamp, when I expect to have more complex questions
          and issues. I hope to create more of a dialogue with my cohort, as
          maybe we will be able to help each other. It would be great to have
          that community feeling in terms of problem-solving as well.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now that I have a stronger sense of what learning to code is like,
          <strong>my personal commitment</strong> to the workload is clearer and
          stronger. I feel really passionate about this learning environment. I
          think I have made the right choice for my future. These skills make
          sense to me in a creative sense, as well as in terms of building a
          career, and they are going to help me reach my goals. I intend to
          regularly make space in my weekly schedule to meet with members of the
          cohort, and I hope to make some friends. I am excited to have the 1:1
          sessions, and have started keeping a list of questions I have.
          Essentially, I am committed to doing what I need to in order to get
          through Bootcamp with the same passion I have for learning as I do
          now. I'm excited to explore all this in the context of personal
          projects as well as the course challenges, so that I can hit the
          ground running later in the year as we learn about presenting to
          industry people!

        <p class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
        <p>
          My long-term career goals are centred around flexibility and
          intellectual stimulation. I am a single Mama, and being present for my
          daughter as she grows up is paramount. To that end, I believe working
          in the tech sector will allow me to build flexibility into my work
          schedule. By this I mean having some ability to work remotely when
          needed, and to work on projects as opposed to just putting in a 9-5. I
          also want to work at solving problems so that my work feels useful and
          meaningful, as well as intellectually stimulating. I am a hard worker,
          but I struggle to stay engaged if I don’t have any room to grow. I’m
          excited to be developing skills that will allow me to work hard at
          something I’m invested in.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        </p>
        <p>
          I love to learn. I enjoy the challenges that come with it, and I’m
          comfortable being in a state of not-knowing. I like research, and I’m
          experienced at the learning process. My limitations are mostly about
          time and focus at the moment, as I adjust to my role as a working
          parent. However, that just takes time, and I feel confident in my
          ability to find a way to make it work for us.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to develop confidence with operating in the tech sector, as I
          build up a stock of technical skills. I want to feel confident
          navigating a new arena, including working with a team on a project.
          This is an entirely new area for me, and I'm interested in how
          different the collaboration will be.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          How will you manage your workload in this programme? An explanation of
          how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with
          other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </p>
        <p>
          I have made the commitment to entering this career path, and that
          means growing into a role within it. I intend to bring my existing
          skillset to the role, and work hard at learning new things. I've
          established a routine to clear space throughout the week, and I feel
          excited about learning. This means I'm happy to put in more hours as
          needed, in evenings and on weekends, to make it happen. I've
          experienced heavy workloads and deadlines before, and I always make it
          work. If I hit the wall, I'm really comfortable asking for help or
          support from the team too.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </p>
        <p>
          I really do appreciate the emphasis on seeking help in a timely matter
          — because I’m dealing with a limited amount of free time, I am
          committed to solving problems I’m having within a set timeframe. I
          feel comfortable asking the facilitators for help through the Discord
          group, and phrasing the issues I’m having in a way that the help will
          also be relevant to others. It is a system that seems to work pretty
          seamlessly. I also have access to a family member who works as a
          front-end developer for a big tech company, and he has been acting as
          an informal mentor. I think between the two I’ll be able to address
          any issues that arise.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </p>
        <p>
          I am hoping the facilitation team are there for the support I’ll
          undoubtedly need as we progress to more complex information! So far
          everyone has been very supportive. By support, I mean being available
          to answer questions and offer explanations for things that are
          confusing me, or directing me to where the information is. I also
          appreciate that there is some existing understanding about the
          challenges of parenting while studying (more for reassurance than
          anything!). My hope is that if I’m missing something, the facilitation
          team will draw my attention to it so I can address it early.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a single Mama, and therefore have a number of childcare
          obligations. I have set aside blocks of time each week where my
          daughter is in preschool (9am to 2pm, three days a week), and have
          arranged with her grandparents to have regular care on the other two
          days (for a similar block of time). That means I should have a
          consistent block of time available for work, plus additional time in
          the evenings if I need more. That means I am busy doing school
          drop-off and pick-up at 8:45am, and 2pm on Tuesday, Thursday, and
          Friday.
