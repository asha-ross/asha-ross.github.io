        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? What are you hoping
        to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you
        like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in
        mind? What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be
        in Bootcamp? Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2.
        Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you
        discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will
        help/hinder you during Bootcamp? What do you think your biggest
        non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be? While you will face many
        technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to
        consider in this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on
        top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group,
        keeping focused for nine weeks, etc. What non-technical skills - human
        skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
        Academy? At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and
        improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some
        areas for development you would like to work on? For example, this could
        be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving
        and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving
        your self-awareness and reflective skills. What are your expectations
        from the Bootcamp team? What does support look like to you? Keep in
        mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but
        it is helpful to voice these expectations. What are your expectations of
        yourself on Bootcamp Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where
        will you seek help in a timely way? Write down a commitment to how you
        will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an
        explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
        representatives.

        <p class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
        <p>
          My long-term career goals are centred around flexibility and
          intellectual stimulation. I am a single Mama, and being present for my
          daughter as she grows up is paramount. To that end, I believe working
          in the tech sector will allow me to build flexibility into my work
          schedule. By this I mean having some ability to work remotely when
          needed, and to work on projects as opposed to just putting in a 9-5. I
          also want to work at solving problems so that my work feels useful and
          meaningful, as well as intellectually stimulating. I am a hard worker,
          but I struggle to stay engaged if I don’t have any room to grow. I’m
          excited to be developing skills that will allow me to work hard at
          something I’m invested in.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        </p>
        <p>
          I love to learn. I enjoy the challenges that come with it, and I’m
          comfortable being in a state of not-knowing. I like research, and I’m
          experienced at the learning process. My limitations are mostly about
          time and focus at the moment, as I adjust to my role as a working
          parent. However, that just takes time, and I feel confident in my
          ability to find a way to make it work for us.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to develop confidence with operating in the tech sector, as I
          build up a stock of technical skills. I want to feel confident
          navigating a new arena, including working with a team on a project.
          This is an entirely new area for me, and I'm interested in how
          different the collaboration will be.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          How will you manage your workload in this programme? An explanation of
          how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with
          other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </p>
        <p>
          I have made the commitment to entering this career path, and that
          means growing into a role within it. I intend to bring my existing
          skillset to the role, and work hard at learning new things. I've
          established a routine to clear space throughout the week, and I feel
          excited about learning. This means I'm happy to put in more hours as
          needed, in evenings and on weekends, to make it happen. I've
          experienced heavy workloads and deadlines before, and I always make it
          work. If I hit the wall, I'm really comfortable asking for help or
          support from the team too.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </p>
        <p>
          I really do appreciate the emphasis on seeking help in a timely matter
          — because I’m dealing with a limited amount of free time, I am
          committed to solving problems I’m having within a set timeframe. I
          feel comfortable asking the facilitators for help through the Discord
          group, and phrasing the issues I’m having in a way that the help will
          also be relevant to others. It is a system that seems to work pretty
          seamlessly. I also have access to a family member who works as a
          front-end developer for a big tech company, and he has been acting as
          an informal mentor. I think between the two I’ll be able to address
          any issues that arise.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </p>
        <p>
          I am hoping the facilitation team are there for the support I’ll
          undoubtedly need as we progress to more complex information! So far
          everyone has been very supportive. By support, I mean being available
          to answer questions and offer explanations for things that are
          confusing me, or directing me to where the information is. I also
          appreciate that there is some existing understanding about the
          challenges of parenting while studying (more for reassurance than
          anything!). My hope is that if I’m missing something, the facilitation
          team will draw my attention to it so I can address it early.
        </p>

        <p class="question">
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a single Mama, and therefore have a number of childcare
          obligations. I have set aside blocks of time each week where my
          daughter is in preschool (9am to 2pm, three days a week), and have
          arranged with her grandparents to have regular care on the other two
          days (for a similar block of time). That means I should have a
          consistent block of time available for work, plus additional time in
          the evenings if I need more. That means I am busy doing school
          drop-off and pick-up at 8:45am, and 2pm on Tuesday, Thursday, and
          Friday.
