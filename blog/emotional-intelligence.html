    <strong>Emotional Intelligence is:</strong>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is our awareness and understanding of our emotions
      and how they affect and influence our behaviour. This in particular
      pertains to our capacity to control and express our emotions, and how our
      own emotional environment affects others. In terms of our relationships
      with others, emotional intelligence also encompasses empathy and our
      ability to engage with and understand another perspective.
    </p>
    <strong>EQ is different to IQ:</strong>
    <p>
      IQ refers more to our intellectual and cognitive abilities, our knowledge
      retention, logical thinking, and problem-solving in an analytic sense. EQ
      (as explored above) is about emotional and social skills, our empathy and
      self-awareness (and self-control).
    </p>
    <strong>EQ is important because</strong>
    <p>
      It influences how we understand ourselves, and influences every
      interaction we have with others. Without developing our emotional
      intelligence, we would struggle in any social scenario. We would also
      struggle with any problem-solving that would have anything to do with
      others, because we would have no real sense for how our perspective
      affected, aligned, or deviated from that of other people. <br />Beyond
      that, emotional intelligence is important for our overall worldview and
      life experience. The more we understand ourselves, the more power we have
      to dictate our future. While many things are out of our control, all of
      our behaviour is under our control. With greater emotional intellgience,
      comes greater self-control, and with more self-control comes the power to
      focus our energy into areas of personal passion.
